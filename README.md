# HIV Disparity Analysis in Minority Americans--- Using K-means and Tableau

## Objective

The goal is to explore the racial disparity and gender disparity existing in the HIV pandemic of US. Providing practical suggestions based on findings.

## Data Source

Data can be divided into National scope and NYC scope ranging from 2010 to 2019.

National Data comes from https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/hiv-aids-statistical-tables/

NYC data comes from https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/hiv-aids-annual-surveillance-statistics.page

## Structure

• Extract data from PDF into csv form.

• Conduct EDA on data using Tableau and Python

• Perform K-means to reveal the relationship between HIV infection rate and state racial composition

• Research papers to bring up practical solutions to the HIV disparity that we find accordingly

## Conclusion
### Racial Aspect:
• In total, 27% of infections that happened in White people, 45% of cases were derived from Black people.

• For every new infection case, every 1 White people get an infection, 4.4 Hispanic people and 9 Black people will get infected.

• Black community has less access to health care after getting infection.

• In both state level and district level, there is a clear correlation between the high density of HIV infections in the black neighborhoods.

### Gender Aspect:
• The key to reducing HIV infection in women lies in the control of infection in men because 83.7% of the infections of females are caused by heterosexual contact.

• Women are more easily getting infected than men when using infected syringes.

## Recommendations
• Modify and adopt South African 90–90–90 program to improve Black people's less access to health care.

• Learn from Washington DC's federal needle exchange program and better reporting to decrease female's susceptibility of infection.

• Increase the housing funding from HIV-AIDS funding to improve the high infection happening in the Black neighborhoods.
